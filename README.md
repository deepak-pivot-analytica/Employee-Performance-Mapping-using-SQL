**Introduction**
The focus is on building an employee performance mapping solution for a data science startup. 
We will use SQL to accurately map employees and track their performance.
**Situation**
ScienceQtech is a startup that works in the Data Science field. ScienceQtech has worked on fraud detection, market basket, self-driving cars, supply chain, algorithmic early detection of lung cancer, customer sentiment, and the drug 
discovery field. With the annual appraisal cycle around the corner, the HR department has asked you (Junior Database Administrator) to generate reports on employee details, their performance, and on the project that the employees have 
undertaken, to analyze the employee database and extract specific data based on different requirements.
**Task**
To facilitate a better understanding, managers have provided ratings for each 
employee which will help the HR department to finalize the employee performance 
mapping. As a DBA, you should find the maximum salary of the employees and 
ensure that all jobs meet the organization's profile standard. You also need to 
calculate bonuses to find extra costs for expenses. 
This will improve the overall 
performance of the organization by ensuring that all required employees receive 
training.
